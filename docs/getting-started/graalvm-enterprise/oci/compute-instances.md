# Get Started with GraalVM Enterprise on OCI

[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud) offers Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition for free to its customers.
GraalVM Enterprise support is included in the Oracle Cloud subscription.

This guide focuses on installing GraalVM Enterprise on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Virtual Machine (VM) Compute Instance.
For users who prefer a Bare Metal Machine instance, see [this documentation](https://cloud.oracle.com/iaas/whitepapers/deploying_custom_os_images.pdf).
For complete beginners, [start with this tutorial for creating and launching your first Linux instance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Reference/overviewworkflow.htm?tocpath=Getting%20Started%7CTutorial%20-%20Launching%20Your%20First%20Linux%20Instance%7C_____0).

### Prerequisites

To replicate the steps in this guide, [create a compute VM instance and connect to it](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Reference/overviewworkflow.htm?tocpath=Getting%20Started%7CTutorial%20-%20Launching%20Your%20First%20Linux%20Instance%7C_____0).

## Install GraalVM Enterprise

For convenient installation, GraalVM Enterprise RPMs have been made available in the OCI YUM repository.
That means that OCI customers can use the GraalVM Enterprise environment in their cloud instances by installing it with `yum` - a package-management utility for the Linux operating systems.

For demonstration purposes, a demo-instance of the **VM.Standard.E4.Flex** shape with the **Oracle Linux 7.9** pre-built image was created.
The following SSH command is then used to connect to a Linux instance from a Unix-style system:
```shell
ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa opc@INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
```

In this instance, `.ssh/id_rsa` is the full path and name of the file containing the private SSH key, `opc` is the default name for the Oracle Linux image, and `INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP` is the instance IP address provisioned from the console.
For more details, refer to theÂ [Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/testingconnection.htm) tutorial.

1. Having connected to the instance, verify which GraalVM Enterprise RPMs are available for the installation, narrowing down the search to the latest release, and Java 11.

   ```shell
   yum check-update
   sudo yum provides graalvm22-ee-11-jdk
   ```
   The resulting list includes both current and previous versions of all of the core package and additional features.

2. Find the appropriate RPM package name, and install GraalVM Enterprise with `sudo yum install <package_name>`.
For example, to install the latest version of "Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition JDK11 Java Development Kit", run:

   ```shell
   sudo yum install graalvm22-ee-11-jdk
   ```
   The dependent packages, e.g., `libpolyglot`, `llvm` and so on, will also be resolved.

   ![See the resolved dependencies for GraalVM Enterprise](dependencies-resolved.png)

   After the installation, the GraalVM Enterprise binary is placed in _/usr/lib64/graalvm_.

3. Set up environment variables to point to the GraalVM Enterprise directory. 

   - Configure the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables in the bash configuration to point to GraalVM Enterprise for this SSH session with the following commands:
   ```shell
   echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib64/graalvm/graalvm22-ee-java11" >> ~/.bashrc
   echo "export PATH='$JAVA_HOME'/bin:'$PATH' " >> ~/.bashrc
   ```
   - Activate this change:
   ```shell
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
   - Verify the values of  `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` to check if the change was successful:
   ```shell
   echo $JAVA_HOME
   echo $PATH
   ```

Now you have a ready-to-go VM instance with GraalVM Enterprise installed and ready to use.

## Install Additional Features

1. Check what additional features are available for your current GraalVM Enterprise version:

   ```shell
   yum check-update
   sudo yum provides graalvm22*
   ```

2. Look up the necessary RPM package name and add it to GraalVM Enterprise with the `yum install <package_name> command` command.
For example, to install [Native Image](../../../reference-manual/native-image/README.md), which is a technology to turn your Java application into a standalone native executable, run this command:

   ```shell
   sudo yum install graalvm22-ee-11-native-image
   ```
   All required dependencies will be automatically installed:

   ![See the resolved dependencies for GraalVM Enterprise Native Image](ni-dependencies-resolved.png)

> **Note:** To add Native Image to GraalVM Enterprise on Oracle Linux 8, currently run these commands:
   ```shell
   sudo yum update -y oraclelinux-release-el8
   sudo yum config-manager --set-enabled ol8_codeready_builder
   sudo yum install graalvm22-ee-11-native-image
   ```
   For Linux images with `dnf` or `microdnf` default package managers, run:
   ```shell
   dnf update -y oraclelinux-release-el8
   dnf --enablerepo ol8_codeready_builder
   dnf install graalvm22-ee-11-native-image
   ```

## Update GraalVM Enterprise

The `yum` package manager for Oracle Linux can be used to update an existing GraalVM installation or replace it with another version. 

1. To update GraalVM, for example, from version 21.x to 22.x and install the distribution for Java 17 instead of Java 11, run:

   ```shell
   sudo yum install graalvm22-ee-17-jdk
   ```

2. Confirm if the installed package size is okay by typing `yes` at the prompt.
3. Check the Java version to see if the update was successful:

   ```shell
   java -version
   ```

The **graalvm22-ee-17-jdk** package is installed alongside **graalvm21-ee-11-jdk** in the _/usr/lib64/graalvm_ directory. Note that regardless the version printed to the console, the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables still point to the old version. Reset the variables as described in [Install GraalVM Enterprise](#install-graalvm-enterprise), step 3.

### Note on `yum upgrade`

The `yum upgrade` command can be used to update on the same year package line, for example, to upgrade from GraalVM Enterprise 22.0.0 to version 22.0.1 when this RPM package becomes available:

   ```shell
   sudo yum upgrade graalvm22-ee-17-jdk
   ```

It will update the whole system and remove the obsolete GraalVM Enterprise installation.
