# Debug Info Feature

To add debug info to a generated native image, add the flag
`-H:GenerateDebugInfo=<N>` to the native image command line (where `N` is
a positive integer value -- the default value `0` means generate no
debug info). For example,
```shell
javac Hello.java
native-image -H:GenerateDebugInfo=1 Hello
```
The resulting image should contain code (method) debug records in a
format the GNU Debugger (GDB) (or Visual Studio) understands.
At present it makes no difference which positive value is supplied to the `GenerateDebugInfo` option.

The `GenerateDebugInfo` option also enables caching of sources for any
JDK runtime classes, GraalVM classes, and application classes which can
be located during native image generation. By default, the cache is
created under local subdirectory sources (a command line option can be
used to specify an alternative location). It is used to configure
source file search path roots for the debugger. Files in the cache are
located in a directory hierarchy that matches the file path
information included in the native image debug records. The source
cache should contain all the files needed to debug the generated image
and nothing more. This local cache provides a convenient way of making
just the necessary sources available to the debugger or IDE when
debugging a native image.

The implementation tries to be smart about locating source files. It
uses the current `JAVA_HOME` to locate the JDK src.zip when searching
for JDK runtime sources. It also uses entries in the classpath to
suggest locations for GraalVM source files and application source
files (see below for precise details of the scheme used to identify
source locations). However, source layouts do vary and it may not be
possible to find all sources. Hence, users can specify the location of
source files explicitly on the command line using option
`DebugInfoSourceSearchPath`:
```shell
javac --source-path apps/greeter/src \
    -d apps/greeter/classes org/my/greeter/*Greeter.java
javac -cp apps/greeter/classes \
    --source-path apps/hello/src \
    -d apps/hello/classes org/my/hello/Hello.java
native-image -H:GenerateDebugInfo=1 \
    -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/hello/src \
    -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/greeter/src \
    -cp apps/hello/classes:apps/greeter/classes org.my.hello.Hello
```
The `DebugInfoSourceSearchPath` option can be repeated as many times as
required to notify all the target source locations. The value passed
to this option can be either an absolute or relative path. It can
identify either a directory, a source JAR, or a source zip file. It is
also possible to specify several source roots at once using a comma
separator:
```shell
native-image -H:GenerateDebugInfo=1 \
    -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/hello/target/hello-sources.jar,apps/greeter/target/greeter-sources.jar \
    -cp apps/target/hello.jar:apps/target/greeter.jar \
    org.my.Hello
```
By default, the cache of application, GraalVM, and JDK sources is
located under local directory sources. The `DebugInfoSourceCacheRoot`
option can be used to specify an alternative location for the top level
directory. As an example, the following variant of the previous
command specifies the same target but employs an absolute path:
```shell
SOURCE_CACHE_ROOT=$PWD/sources
native-image -H:GenerateDebugInfo=1 \
    -H:DebugInfoSourceCacheRoot=$SOURCE_CACHE_ROOT \
    -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/hello/target/hello-sources.jar,apps/greeter/target/greeter-sources.jar \
    -cp apps/target/hello.jar:apps/target/greeter.jar \
    org.my.Hello
```
If you specify a root directory that does not yet exist, it will be
created during population of the cache.

Note that in all the examples above the `DebugInfoSourceSearchPath`
options are actually redundant. In the first case, the classpath
entries for _apps/hello/classes_ and _apps/greeter/classes_ will be used
to derive the default search roots `apps/hello/src` and
_apps/greeter/src_. In the second case, the classpath entries for
_apps/target/hello.jar_ and _apps/target/greeter.jar_ will be used to
derive the default search roots _apps/target/hello-sources.jar_ and
_apps/target/greeter-sources.jar_.


## Currently Implemented Features

The currently implemented features include:

  - break points configured by file and line, or by method name
  - single stepping by line including both into and over function calls
  - stack backtraces (not including frames detailing inlined code)

Note that single stepping within a compiled method includes file and
line number info for inlined code, including inlined GraalVM methods.
So, the debugger may switch files even though you are still in the same
compiled method.

### Identifying the Location of Source Code

One goal of the implementation is to make it simple to configure your
debugger so that it can identify the relevant source file when it
stops during program execution. The native image builder tries to
achieve this by accumulating the relevant sources in a suitably
structured file cache.

The native image builder uses different strategies to locate source
files for JDK runtime classes, GraalVM classes, and application source
classes for inclusion in the local sources cache. It identifies which
strategy to use based on the package name of the class. So, for
example, packages starting with `java.*` or `jdk.*` are JDK classes;
packages starting with `org.graal.*` or `com.oracle.svm.*` are GraalVM
classes; any other packages are regarded as application classes.

Sources for JDK runtime classes are retrieved from the _src.zip_ found
in the JDK release used to run the native image generation process.
Retrieved files are cached under subdirectory _sources/jdk_, using the
module name (for JDK11) and package name of the associated class to
define the directory hierarchy in which the source is located.

For example, on Linux the source for `class java.util.HashMap` will
be cached in file _sources/jdk/java.base/java/util/HashMap.java_. Debug
info records for this class and its methods will identify this source
file using the relative directory path _java.base/java/util_ and file
name _HashMap.java_. On Windows things will be the same modulo use of
'\' rather than '/' as the file separator.

Sources for GraalVM classes are retrieved from zip files or source
directories derived from entries in the classpath. Retrieved files are
cached under subdirectory _sources/graal_, using the package name of the
associated class to define the directory hierarchy in which the source
is located (e.g., class `com.oracle.svm.core.VM` has its source file
cached at `sources/graal/com/oracle/svm/core/VM.java`).

The lookup scheme for cached GraalVM sources varies depending upon
what is found in each classpath entry. Given a JAR file entry like
_/path/to/foo.jar_, the corresponding file _/path/to/foo.src.zip_ is
considered as a candidate zip file system from which source files may
be extracted. When the entry specifies a dir like _/path/to/bar_ then
directories _/path/to/bar/src_ and _/path/to/bar/src_gen_ are considered
as candidates. Candidates are skipped when the zip file or source
directory does not exist, or it does not contain at least one
subdirectory hierarchy that matches one of the the expected GraalVM
package hierarchies.

Sources for application classes are retrieved from source JAR files or
source directories derived from entries in the classpath. Retrieved
files are cached under subdirectory _sources/src_, using the package
name of the associated class to define the directory hierarchy in
which the source is located (e.g., class `org.my.foo.Foo` has its
source file cached as `sources/src/org/my/foo/Foo.java`).

The lookup scheme for cached application sources varies depending upon
what is found in each classpath entry. Given a JAR file entry like
_/path/to/foo.jar_, the corresponding JAR _/path/to/foo-sources.jar_ is
considered as a candidate zip file system from which source files may
be extracted. When the entry specifies a dir like _/path/to/bar/classes_
or _/path/to/bar/target/classes_ then one of the directories
_/path/to/bar/src/main/java_, _/path/to/bar/src/java_ or _/path/to/bar/src_
is selected as a candidate (in that order of preference). Finally, the
current directory in which the Native Image program is being run is
also considered as a candidate.

These lookup strategies are only provisional and may need extending in the
future. However, it is possible to make missing sources
available by other means. One option is to unzip extra app source JAR files,
or copy extra app source trees into the cache. Another is to
configure extra source search paths.

### Configuring Source Paths in GNU Debugger

By default, GDB will employ the three local directory roots
`sources/{jdk,graal,src}` to locate the source files for your app classes, GraalVM
classes, and JDK runtime classes. If the sources cache is not located in the
directory in which you run GDB, you can configure the required paths using the
following command:
```
(gdb) set directories /path/to/sources/jdk:/path/to/sources/graal:/path/to/sources/src
```
THe `/path/to/sources/jdk` directory should contain source files for all JDK runtime
classes referenced from debug records.

The `/path/to/sources/graal` directory should contain source files for all GraalVM
classes referenced from debug records. Note that the current
implementation does not yet find some sources for the GraalVM JIT
compiler in the _org.graalvm.compiler*_ package subspace.

The `/path/to/sources/src` directory should contain source files for all
application classes referenced from debug records, assuming they can
be located using the lookup strategy described above.

You can supplement the files cached in `sources/src` by unzipping
application source JAR files or copying application source trees into the
cache. You will need to ensure that any new subdirectory you add to
`sources/src` corresponds to the top level package for the classes whose
sources are being included.

You can also add extra directories to the search path using the `set directories` command:
```shell
(gdb) set directories /path/to/my/sources/:/path/to/my/other/sources
```
Note that the GNU Debugger does not understand zip format file systems so any extra entries you
add must identify a directory tree containing the relevant
sources. Once again, top level entries in the directory added to the
search path must correspond to the top level package for the classes
whose sources are being included.

### Configuring source paths in Visual Studio 

Visual Studio does have a setting for source paths, however it is hidden as a property of
the current 'Solution'.  To enable Visual Studio to access the cached sources, right click 
on the solution in the "Solution Explorer", and select "Properties", then "Debug Source Files".
In the "Debug Source Files" plane, add the cache directories to the source directory list.

## Checking Debug Info on Linux

Note that this is only of interest to those who want to understand how the
debug info implementation works or want to troubleshoot problems
encountered during debugging that might relate to the debug info
encoding.

The `objdump` command can be used to display the debug info embedded
into a native image. The following commands (which all assume the
target binary is called `hello`) can be used to display all generated content:
```
objdump --dwarf=info hello > info
objdump --dwarf=abbrev hello > abbrev
objdump --dwarf=ranges hello > ranges
objdump --dwarf=decodedline hello > decodedline
objdump --dwarf=rawline hello > rawline
objdump --dwarf=str hello > str
objdump --dwarf=frames hello > frames
```

The *info* section includes details of all compiled Java methods.

The *abbrev* section defines the layout of records in the info section
that describe Java files (compilation units) and methods.

The *ranges* section details the start and end addresses of method
code segments.

The *decodedline* section maps subsegments of method code range
segments to files and line numbers. This mapping includes entries
for files and line numbers for inlined methods.

The *rawline* segment provides details of how the line table is
generated using DWARF state machine instructions that encode file,
line, and address transitions.

The *str* section provides a lookup table for strings referenced
from records in the info section.

The *frames* section lists transition points in compiled methods
where a (fixed size) stack frame is pushed or popped, allowing
the debugger to identify each frame's current and previous stack
pointers and its return address.

Note that some of the content embedded in the debug records is
generated by the C compiler and belongs to code that is either in
libraries or the C lib bootstrap code that is bundled in with the
Java method code.

### Currently Supported Targets

The prototype is currently implemented for the GNU Debugger on Linux and Visual Studio on Windows

  - Linux/x86_64 support has been tested and should work
    correctly.

  - Linux/AArch64 support is present but has not yet been fully
    verified (break points should work ok but stack backtraces
    may be incorrect).

  - Windows/X86_64 support has known issues with stack backtraces.

### Windows notes

  -  The first main() function encountered can be referenced as _package.class.main_.  Setting  

  - Currently stack frames are not properly expressed in the debug info. The 
  stack frame display may have extraneous entries in it, and "Step Out", may work incorrectly.

  - Currently there is no type information in the debug info; as a consequence, variables
  and members do not appear in the debug information.
